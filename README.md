# Task 1: Linux Based Task with Socket.io

The goal was to learn about websockets and create a chat application using node js
I learnt about websockets in general and how they are responsible for building effienct chat systems.I was also introduced to Node.js and Express.js and the differnt methods of creating a chat app.
I also built a real time chat app ith HTML and express.js
## What is Socket io?

**Socket.IO** is a JavaScript library that enables real-time, bidirectional communication between a web server and clients (browsers or mobile apps). It's built on top of WebSocket technology, providing a more robust and flexible way to handle real-time events compared to traditional HTTP polling.

#### What is the problem with polling??
With HTTP polling, the client constantly sends requests to the server asking for updates. This can be inefficient, wasting bandwidth and server resources on unnecessary communication
- As the number of clients increases, the server load can become overwhelming due to the constant polling requests
So Socket io was introduced

### Express.js over node.js
Express.js is better than plain Node.js for web development because it simplifies routing, request handling, and middleware management, improving code organization

#### CORS in WebSockets: A Brief Overview

**CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)** is a mechanism that allows a web page to make requests to a server on a different domain than the one that served the web page. While CORS is primarily used for HTTP requests, it also plays a role in WebSockets.
